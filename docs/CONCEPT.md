# Project Concept

## Mission

Ambient Gaza preserves Gaza soundscapes as an act of resistance against erasure during the ongoing genocide. This project serves as both artistic statement and practical solidarity with Palestinian people.

## The Concept

**Ambient Gaza** is designed as an ambient long player - music to be listened to on repeat as background music. Every track incorporates different soundscapes from Gaza recorded before the current wave of destruction:

- Olive harvests
- Children playing  
- Gaza beach
- Marketplaces
- Everyday life sounds

In listening to these sounds, there is an opportunity to:
- **Grieve** for the loss of life and ways of life
- **Embody** these sounds so they do not fade
- **Resist** erasure through active remembering
- **Hope** that these sounds will be heard again by Palestinians in their homeland

## How It Works

1. **Collect** Gaza soundscapes (pre-destruction only)
2. **Create** ambient music incorporating these sounds
3. **Release** on streaming platforms and Bandcamp
4. **Donate** 95%+ of royalties to Palestinian NGOs
5. **Amplify** through social media and activist networks

## Current Status

**Released:** Album available on Bandcamp
**Censored:** Spotify repeatedly denied our artist claims for being pro-Palestinian
**Seeking:** Soundscape contributions for Volume 2
**Planning:** Interactive installation and sound mapping project

## Original Fundraising Model

The project was designed around streaming economics:
- 20-24 hours of listening generates ~£1 in royalties
- 1,000 daily listeners = £1,000 per day
- Monthly potential: £30,000 for Palestinian NGOs

Due to platform censorship, we now rely on:
- Direct Bandcamp sales
- PayPal donations
- Social media amplification

## Partners & Supporters

- **The Palestinian Sound Archive**
- **Mohammed Jabaly** (filmmaker)
- **Radio Alhara** (Bethlehem)
- **Glastonbury Festival** (2024 booking)
- London protest networks

## Artistic Origins

The idea originated from one of the artists's artworks compiling soundscapes from Gaza for London protest gatherings and vigils. This album expands that concept into a sustained act of sonic solidarity.

## Future Development

**Volume 2:** Actively seeking new soundscape contributions and artist collaborations

**Installation:** Planning interactive sound mapping project centering Palestinian lived experiences

**Advisory Panel:** Creating guidance structure for NGO selection and fund distribution

## Core Principles

- **Anonymity:** All contributors remain anonymous, centering listening over recognition
- **Safety:** Rigorous vetting ensures no person can be identified or located
- **Transparency:** Clear communication about fund distribution
- **Resistance:** Art as a form of non-violent resistance to erasure
