- Everyday life sounds: marketplaces, olive harvests, children playing, beach sounds
- Cultural moments: celebrations, gatherings, traditional music
- Natural sounds: birds, waves, wind through olive trees
- Urban sounds: street life, calls to prayer, conversations

**How to submit:**
- Email your audio files with "Soundscape Submission" in the subject line
- Include brief context about when/where it was recorded (no personal details)
